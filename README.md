💻 No AI coding yet—just thinking, planning, and breaking stuff down.

## 👤 Who We’re Analyzing
**Student** – basically anyone tryna level up their knowledge.  

🎓 Pro tip: everyone has skills, we just gotta spot ’em.

A student’s daily grind looks like this:  
- 🎓 Attending classes (so you don’t fall behind)  
- 📚 Studying (books + notes = grind)
